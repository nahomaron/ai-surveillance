# WORKPLAN — RQ1 single-agent implementation schedule

**Owner:** Research Owner · **Implementer:** one Claude Code agent on the Owner's MacBook Air · **Remote:** the Owner's GitHub repository
**Contract:** E-1.2.2 (E-1.2.1 FROZEN + F.1 Part A + Appendix N) · **Plan details:** Package F
**Mode change (9 Nov 2026, Owner decision):** a single agent replaces the multi-agent team. F.1 Parts B and C are superseded. Its safeguards are kept in simpler form: tests written first from the documents, no editing of expected values, determinism re-runs, a self-audit at each milestone, and Owner review at STOP points.

How to use this file:
- Work tasks **in order**. A task may start only when the tasks in its `needs` are ticked.
- Status markers: `[ ]` open · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[B]` blocked (reason in the log) · `[S]` STOP — waiting for the Owner.
- Size is a rough guide: S ≈ one session, M ≈ 2–3 sessions, L ≈ 4+ sessions.

## 0. Owner pre-approvals (the Owner ticks these before the first session)

| Approval | Ticked |
|---|---|
| Create `.venv` and `pip install` the packages named in S-01 into it | [-] |
| After M0 is accepted: download one SDG-Warehouse near-miss shard and selected synthetic SmartSpaces scenes, **22 GB cap in total, outside git**, **after** recording source authenticity and licence terms in T-17. Real-world scenes (`Warehouse_026`, `Warehouse_027` and any other real footage) are excluded (Owner decision D-3, 9 Nov 2026) | [-] |
| Install CPU-only PyTorch or ONNX Runtime for the detector benchmark (T-22), if available for this platform | [-] |

Never pre-approved: paid services, cloud upload of data, real worker footage, fine-tuning compute purchases, any contract change.

**Owner setup before the first session:**
1. Update Claude Code (installed via MacPorts) and check `claude --version`.
2. Create the GitHub repository and connect the local repository to it (`git remote add origin …`).
3. Copy the documents into the repository: `CLAUDE.md` and `WORKPLAN.md` (root); the frozen contract and F.1 into `docs/contract/`; Package F into `docs/plan/`; C.1, D, D.1 into `docs/methodology/`.
4. Start Claude Code in the repository and give it the kickoff prompt from §7.

## 2. Milestone M1a — oracle-perception synthetic slice (after G-M0)

| ✓ | ID | Task | Needs | Refs | Done when | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [ ] | T-17 | **Dataset qualification (WP-12).** Record source URLs, versions, licence terms and authenticity evidence **before** downloading.

## 3. Milestone M1b — detector-based slice (after G-M1a)

| ✓ | ID | Task | Needs | Done when | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [ ] | T-22 | **Detector benchmark (WP-15).** Check whether CPU PyTorch or ONNX Runtime installs on this Mac. If it doesn't → **STOP** with options. Benchmark pretrained detectors on a small frame subset; record what COCO models output on forklifts (not assumed zero); licence table | G-M1a; §0 approval | Benchmark report | M |

| [B] | T-25 | **M1b integration (WP-18). BLOCKED** on T-24, or on a qualified pretrained forklift detector from T-22 | T-24 | — | — |

**Later work, not scheduled until the Owner decides:** E2 measurement (E2-W1/W2 after M1a, using T-07's findings), multi-camera linkage (M2), real-data collection (requires ethics approval), the FM-X1 annotation-efficiency experiment.

---

## 4. Rules at a glance

- **Blocked by a contract question:** add an entry to `docs/CHANGE_REQUESTS.md`, mark the task `[B]`, and continue with the next task that does not depend on it.
- **Test fails against an Appendix N value:** fix the code. If you believe the document is wrong, open a CR and stop that task. **Never edit the expected value.**
- **Any STOP:** write it in `DECISIONS_NEEDED.md`, push, and stop dependent work.
- **Push:** at the end of every task and every session, and at every milestone (with a tag).

## 5. Milestone self-audit checklist

- [ ] Full suite passes from a clean clone with the locked environment.
- [ ] Two complete runs produce identical artifact IDs for exact-class stages.
- [ ] Every Appendix N expected value is asserted by at least one test, and none was edited after first commit (check with `git log -p` on the expected-value files).
- [ ] No fixture (TEST-ONLY) configuration appears in any research export or report.
- [ ] Reports use only the permitted wording and the three-status board.
- [ ] Open CRs and blockers are listed in the milestone report.
- [ ] No data files, videos or secrets are committed.

## 6. Templates

## 7. Kickoff prompt (the Owner pastes this into the first session)

> Read CLAUDE.md and WORKPLAN.md, then the contract documents they list. Start at the first open task in WORKPLAN.md and follow the work loop. Log progress in WORKPLAN.md, commit and push after every task, and stop at any STOP or when the Owner's approval is needed.

**Kickoff prompt for later sessions:**

> Continue the RQ1 implementation: read CLAUDE.md, check the Progress log and DECISIONS_NEEDED.md, then resume the next open task in WORKPLAN.md.

## Progress log

_(the agent appends entries here)_

### 2026-11-09 — S-01 done
- Did: Checked wheels on CPython 3.15.2 and 3.14.3 (all present). Created `.venv` on 3.15.2 under the §0 approval. Recorded versions in `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`. Lock reinstalled identically in a clean environment.
- Tests: no suite yet; imports and smoke calls passed for all nine packages
- Commit: af2e6fc (pushed, branch `m0-implementation`)
- Problems / CRs: `docs/`, `WORKPLAN.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are git-ignored and the repository is public, so these records stay local (D-2).
- Next: S-02

### 2026-11-09 — S-02 done
- Did: Package layout, pytest configuration, data paths ignored, `DECISIONS_NEEDED.md`, `docs/CHANGE_REQUESTS.md`.
- Tests: 0/0 (pytest runs, nothing collected), determinism re-run: not applicable
- Commit: 3a5666d (pushed)
- Problems / CRs: none
- Next: T-01

### 2026-11-09 — T-01 BLOCKED (part A pushed)
- Did: Part A only. One schema source for 64 tables with Arrow and JSON Schema generators, JCS wrapper, error registry, and the 7 VR rules with enforceable text, each with a passing and a failing fixture. Coverage report in `reports/T-01_vr_coverage.md`.
- Not done: 26 VR rules and CT-E-01, 05, 30 have no text in the normative documents, so "Done when" cannot be met. VR-E-040 is deferred to T-15.
- Tests: 318/318 (full suite), determinism re-run: identical (318/318; coverage report byte-identical)
- Commit: b96a882 (pushed)
- Problems / CRs: CR-001 (blocking; D-1), CR-002 (schema gaps, provisional handling marked in code).
- Next: T-07, the only task independent of T-01. T-02 onward wait for D-1.

### 2026-11-09 — T-07 done
- Did: Reviewed public dataset cards and repository metadata only; no dataset files downloaded. Report in `research/e2/E2_feasibility_report.md`. No reviewed dataset documents a worker and an elevated load in one scene with a height reference; E2-W3 needs collection.
- Tests: 318/318 (full suite), determinism re-run: identical (318/318)
- Commit: db58389 (pushed)
- Problems / CRs: D-3 raised: the SDG shard size means the §0 "~1.5 GB" estimate is too small. SmartSpaces has two real-world scenes that must be excluded.
- Next: STOP for now. All remaining M0 tasks depend on T-01, which waits for D-1 (CR-001).

### 2026-11-09 — Owner decisions recorded
- D-1 resolved by Appendix T (contract E-1.2.3); CR-001 closed. D-3 approved (22 GB cap, §0 row updated). D-2 stays open: `.gitignore` and repository visibility unchanged. Agent authority section added to CLAUDE.md.

### 2026-11-09 — T-01 done
- Did: All 33 active VR rules with one passing and one failing fixture; Parquet read/write; CT-E-01, 05, 30. CT-E-05 is at record level and is re-checked on FX-07 in T-08. VR-E-040's zero-exposure clause is enforced in T-15. Part A expectations for VR-E-070 and the coverage listing were changed because Appendix T amended the rule text.
- Tests: 488/488 (full suite), determinism re-run: identical (488/488; coverage report byte-identical)
- Commit: ecb0985 (pushed)
- Problems / CRs: CR-002 closed by AR-1 to AR-10; AR-11 to AR-15 are new. AR-7 flagged for Architect attention.
- Next: T-02

### 2026-11-09 — T-02 done
- Did: ID classes, ART-ISO, ANC-1, seven-step builder, reconstruction check, lineage trace. Reproduces `art_pmpcesnhpbbgtw2f3fhb6zkqxk` and every Appendix T T5 record ID.
- Tests: 529/529 (full suite), determinism re-run: identical (529/529)
- Commit: b36e61b (pushed)
- Problems / CRs: AR-16, AR-17. CT-I-03, 04, 07, 08 are builder-level until the stages exist.
- Next: T-03

### 2026-11-10 — T-01/T-02 completeness audit
- Did: Checked every Owner decision of 9 Nov against the files: all recorded correctly. Found and fixed: execution.json not matching its schema; no failed-run record; integers above 2^53 crashing the serializer (AR-18); CT-E-01 not applying VR-E-004 to produced artifacts; AR-2, AR-5, AR-6 lacking exact pinning tests.
- Still partial, by design: VR-E-021 checks unit suffixes only (AR-13); VR-E-040 zero-exposure clause waits for T-15; CT-E-05 is record-level until FX-07 runs in T-08; CT-I-03/04/07/08 are builder-level until T-08, T-09, T-14, T-16 (AR-17).
- Commit: 34b1f60 (pushed)
- Next: T-03

### 2026-11-10 — T-03 done
- Did: 46 record fixtures (N1, N2, FX-TIE, FX-W, FX-CM, FX-ID, FX-RC, FX-A3.1, FX-B/C/D, FX-A3/A4, FX-11, FX-12, TEST-ONLY parameters), each citing its source; manifest with hashes; generator refuses inconsistent labels, K and arithmetic.
- Tests: 627/627 (full suite), determinism re-run: identical (generator output byte-compared to committed files)
- Commit: f9994ac (pushed)
- Problems / CRs: AR-19, AR-20. Expected-value files must not change after this commit.
- Next: T-04

### 2026-11-10 — T-04 done
- Did: 14 PyAV-generated clips (FX-CLIP-A–D, VFR, B-frame, duplicate-PTS, dropout, corrupt-packet, two-file, untimed, FX-10), byte-deterministic for this decoder build; `fixtures/clips_manifest.json`.
- Tests: 643/643 (full suite), determinism re-run: identical
- Commit: b404438 (pushed)
- Problems / CRs: AR-21 (timestamp faults are applied by an overlay at demux, because containers repair missing timestamps).
- Next: T-05

### 2026-11-10 — T-05 done
- Did: Registrar with anchor IDs, local and aligned timelines, clock alignments, tiered calibration checks (CB-01, CB-02), CB-03, TI-11, ANC-1 across registrations.
- Tests: 673/673 (full suite), determinism re-run: identical
- Commit: 168811f (pushed)
- Problems / CRs: AR-22, AR-23.
- Next: T-06 is blocked.

### 2026-11-10 — T-06 BLOCKED
- Why: CR-003 and D-4. delta_nom has no definition, and the only earlier wording contradicts Appendix N3 for Cases B and C. f_sub has no stated effect. Both change measured durations or coverage, so they are outside the agent's authority.
- Note for T-06: PyAV exposes only `pts` and `dts` on frames, not FFmpeg's best-effort timestamp. Handle this under an AR when T-06 starts.
- Carry forward: CT-E-05 re-run on FX-07 in T-08; CT-I-03/04/07/08 at pipeline level (AR-17); VR-E-040 export clause in T-15.
- Next: Waiting for D-4. No M0 task is independent of T-06; T-10 needs T-06 and T-11 onward depend on it.

### 2026-11-11 — Owner decisions recorded
- D-2 decided: docs/, WORKPLAN.md and CLAUDE.md are tracked (commits 9ae27b4 and 8bc287d; the first missed two files because a scripted .gitignore edit failed, and the second completes it).
- D-4 approved as contract E-1.2.4: Appendix T section T7 appended verbatim, CR-003 closed, CLAUDE.md contract version updated. T-06 resumed.

### 2026-11-11 — T-06 done
- Did: Timestamp resolution, reorder depth, eligibility, δ_nom per T7 (declared, then adjacent-pair median, then all-timed median), support with capping, exclusion and uncertainty regions, f_sub degradation, coverage tiling per (timeline, camera), S1 artifact. FX-CLIP-A–D reproduce 0.100/0.067/0.033/0.133 s; CT-T-22 gives 0.034 s and 0.068 s.
- Tests: 702/702 (full suite), determinism re-run: identical (S1 artifact IDs equal across runs)
- Commit: 75b0705 (pushed)
- Problems / CRs: AR-24 to AR-28. The AR-5 pinning test was updated because E-1.2.4 adds decode_config fields. Note: with the T7 fixture δ_nom of exactly 0.033 s, δ_max is 0.0495 s (Package F §3 quotes 50 ms), so the 50 ms intervals of the CT-T-01 VFR clip are capped with 17 ms gaps.
- Not yet done here: duration assertions of CT-T-14–19 and CT-T-20 (c, d) belong to T-08.
- Next: T-08 (needs T-06, now done). T-10 also needs T-05 and T-06, both done.

### 2026-11-11 — Architect review of AR-7 and AR-22 applied
- AR-22 accepted; its note is recorded and added to the T-20 row.
- AR-7 revised and applied: event-time columns (`frozen_utc` ×3, `locked_utc`) are stored but outside every hash; the `*_utc` format is exactly YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffffZ; VR-E-054 reads stored event times. SP-01, SP-08 and FT-02 must do the same when written (T-10, T-14).
- One requested test conflicts with F.1 A1.2 (anchor IDs come from the natural key only), so it was implemented to F.1 and raised as CR-004 / D-5.
- Tests: 718/718 (full suite), determinism re-run: identical
- T-06 was already complete (7bc0036) under E-1.2.4 and still passes. Next: T-08.
